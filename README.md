Description
I am a beginner in this area, so I did something simple to get a taste of it. I uploaded a donkey image I took at UCR and a random dog image from the Dog API.

Reflection
I learned a lot from this assignment, including React basics, deploying with Vercel, and revisiting HTML, CSS, and Git commands. Although I faced some issues with Git, I was able to resolve them by researching online. Thank you
